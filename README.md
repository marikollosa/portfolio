**Data Scientist | Applied Statistics | Analytics & Decision-Making**

I am an analyst with a strong focus on applied statistical reasoning and real-world analytics. My work emphasizes building interpretable, robust analytical frameworks that help teams understand complex data, validate assumptions, and make defensible decisions under uncertainty.

This repository contains selected case studies that reflect how I approach open-ended problems, reason about data quality and variability, and translate analysis into solutions that are practical, scalable, and aligned with real operational constraints.

## Case Studies

### IVT Statistical Analysis — Anomaly Detection for Traffic Quality
**Core skills:** Applied statistics, anomaly detection, data validation  

This project explores how to detect abnormal behavior in large-scale traffic data using robust, median-based statistical methods. Rather than relying on mean-driven approaches that are sensitive to outliers, the analysis focuses on interpretability, stability under skewed distributions, and prioritization of investigative effort.

Key themes include:
- Designing metrics that behave well under real-world noise
- Balancing sensitivity and false positives
- Communicating statistical results in an operationally useful way

### Browser-Based Slide Automation Tool
**Core skills:** Automation, systems thinking, applied problem solving  

This project addresses a recurring operational problem: transforming structured data into consistent, presentation-ready outputs. The solution is a fully client-side automation tool designed with usability, maintainability, and privacy constraints in mind.

While not a modeling problem, the project demonstrates:
- Translating ambiguous requirements into a concrete system
- Making explicit tradeoffs between flexibility, simplicity, and scale
- Building tools that reduce error and manual effort in data workflows
